App is hosted with help of OpenServer but should also work with other similar programs such as XAMPP.  
To start on OpenServer clone repository into domains directory and create a new domain with repository as base directory.  
then create a db in phpMyAdmin and name it "conference_db". after this import conference_db.sql in that db.
